## [Ongoing Project] - Tumour Segmentation Labelling Assistant

##
Tumour Segmentation Labelling Assistant is an AI-assisted medical imaging tool designed to help radiologists and researchers annotate tumors in medical scans (MRI, CT, etc.) more efficiently and accurately. It combines pre-trained segmentation models (like U-Net/nnU-Net) with an interactive UI where human experts can review, adjust, and validate the AI-predicted tumor boundaries.

**Key aims:**
- Reduce the time and manual effort in tumor annotation.
- Improve annotation quality for training supervised ML models.
- Support iterative learning (e.g., active learning or correction-feedback loops).
- Enable explainability and uncertainty visualization to foster trust.
